# A Dictionary : A Data Structure that consists of key value pairs.

# We use the keys to describe our data and the values to represent the data 

instructor = {
    "name": "colt",
    "owns_dog" : True,
    "num_courses": 4,
    "favourite_language": "python",
    "from" : "US",
    "insert more" : "here"
}

print(instructor)

# Keys and values are seperated by a colon 
# Our keys are almost numbers or strings

# Another Way of Creating a dictionary is using dict funtion 

another_dictionary = dict(key = "value")
print(another_dictionary)

dict_second = dict(name = "sid" , section = "A" , )
