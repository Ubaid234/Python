# Polymorphism 

# A key principle in OOP is the idea of polymorphism - an object can take on many (poly) forms (morph).

# While a formal definition of polymorphism is more difficult, here are two important practical applications:

# 2. The same operation works for different kinds of objects

# Cat.speak()  # meow
# Dog.speak()  # woof
# Human.speak()  # yo

# 1. The same class method works in a similar way for different classes

sample_list = [1,2,3]
sample_tuple = (1,2,3)
sample_string = "awesome"

len(sample_list)
len(sample_tuple)
len(sample_string)
