# Why OOP?

# With object oriented programming, the goal is to encapsulate your code into logical, hierarchical groupings using classes so that you can reason about your code at a higher level.

# Encapsulation

# Encapsulation - the grouping of public and private attributes and methods into a programmatic class, making abstraction possible

# Abstraction

# Abstraction - exposing only "relevant" data in a class interface, hiding private attributes and methods (aka the "inner workings") from users
